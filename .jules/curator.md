# Curator's Log - Documentation Decision Records (DDR)

## 2025-12-17 - Applied Mathematics Documentation Strategy
**Gap:** The `math_explorer::applied` module contains eclectic submodules (Favoritism, Clinical Trials, etc.) with zero context in `mod.rs`. Users have to guess what "cannibalism" or "favoritism" modules actually do.
**Strategy:** Implement a "Hub and Spoke" documentation pattern.
1. The `applied/mod.rs` acts as a catalog with one-line descriptions for every submodule.
2. The `favoritism` module gets a "Deep Dive" treatment (Theory + Diagram) as a gold standard example.
**Outcome:** Reduced cognitive load for users browsing the API; explicit humor/satire warnings for `favoritism`.

## 2025-12-17 - Crate-Level Documentation Revamp
**Gap:** The `math_explorer/README.md` was effectively "abandonware", listing incorrect modules (`algebra`, `number_theory`) and providing no usage context, confusing users who navigated directly to the crate folder.
**Strategy:** Mirror the Root README structure but scoped to the crate. Define clear boundaries: Root README = Project Vision; Crate README = Developer Implementation Details.
**Outcome:** Established a reliable "Front Door" for the library crate, matching the actual codebase state.

## 2025-12-18 - Clinical Trials Elevation & Cannibalism Clarification
**Gap:** `clinical_trials` was a hidden gem with full implementation but zero docs. `cannibalism` was a confusing placeholder.
**Strategy:**
1. Applied "Hub and Spoke" to `clinical_trials`: Added Mermaid workflow and full example.
2. Labeled `cannibalism` as "Theoretical" with a warning about placeholder status to manage user expectations.
**Outcome:** Bridged the gap between code reality and user perception. High-value code is now visible; low-value code is honestly labeled.

## 2025-12-18 - Climate (CERA) Documentation & Categorization
**Gap:** The `climate` module (CERA framework) was miscategorized in the README as part of `applied`, and its `mod.rs` was nearly empty, hiding a complex and interesting architecture.
**Strategy:**
1.  Apply "Hub and Spoke" pattern to `climate/mod.rs`, explaining the purpose (Climate-invariant Encoding) and components (Autoencoder, Predictor, Loss).
2.  Add a runnable "Hello World" example in `climate/mod.rs` to lower the barrier to entry.
3.  Fix the README to correctly categorize `math_explorer::climate` as a top-level domain.
**Outcome:** CERA is now a first-class citizen in the documentation, and the API surface is accurately reflected in the "Front Door".
