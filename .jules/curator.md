# Curator's Log - Documentation Decision Records (DDR)

## 2025-12-17 - Applied Mathematics Documentation Strategy
**Gap:** The `math_explorer::applied` module contains eclectic submodules (Favoritism, Clinical Trials, etc.) with zero context in `mod.rs`. Users have to guess what "cannibalism" or "favoritism" modules actually do.
**Strategy:** Implement a "Hub and Spoke" documentation pattern.
1. The `applied/mod.rs` acts as a catalog with one-line descriptions for every submodule.
2. The `favoritism` module gets a "Deep Dive" treatment (Theory + Diagram) as a gold standard example.
**Outcome:** Reduced cognitive load for users browsing the API; explicit humor/satire warnings for `favoritism`.
