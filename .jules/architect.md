## 2026-05-15 - [Biology Domain Decomposition]
**Problem:** `math_explorer/src/biology.rs` was a "God File" combining four disparate biological sub-domains: Enzyme Kinetics, Hodgkin-Huxley Neuroscience, Reaction-Diffusion Morphogenesis, and Evolutionary Game Theory.
**Decision:** Applied "Module Extraction" to split `biology.rs` into a directory-based module `math_explorer/src/biology/` with dedicated files: `kinetics.rs`, `neuroscience.rs`, `morphogenesis.rs`, and `evolution.rs`.
**Consequence:** Improved separation of concerns and scalability. Each biological sub-domain is now isolated, making it easier to extend (e.g., adding more neuroscience models) without cluttering unrelated logic. Backward compatibility is fully preserved via `mod.rs` re-exports.
