//! # Applied Game Theory
//!
//! This module provides tools for modeling strategic interactions between rational (or boundedly rational) agents.
//! It covers three distinct scales of interaction:
//!
//! 1. **Mechanism Design**: Single-shot games where the rules are designed to achieve a specific outcome (e.g., auctions).
//! 2. **Classical Equilibrium**: Fixed-point analysis for finding Nash Equilibria in topological spaces.
//! 3. **Evolutionary Dynamics**: Population-scale interactions where strategies evolve over time based on fitness.
//! 4. **Mean Field Games**: The limit of $N \to \infty$ players, modeled using coupled PDE systems.
//!

//! ##  Quick Start: Optimal Auctions
//!
//! Calculate the optimal reserve price for an auction where bidders' valuations are uniformly distributed.
//! According to Myerson's Lemma, this is where the virtual valuation $J(v) = 0$.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use oxidize_applied::game_theory::mechanism_design::optimal_reserve_price;
//! use statrs::distribution::Uniform;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Bidders have valuations uniformly distributed between $0 and $100
//!     let valuation_dist = Uniform::new(0.0, 100.0).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Calculate the revenue-maximizing reserve price
//!     let reserve_price = optimal_reserve_price(&valuation_dist, 0.0, 100.0);
//!
//!     println!("Optimal Reserve Price: ${:.2}", reserve_price);
//!     // For Uniform(0, 100), the answer is $50.
//! }
//! ```
