## 4. Methodology

To satirically quantify maternal favoritism, we assign mathematical expressions to each variable, integrating over time and space where appropriate. Data for each variable is hypothetically collected and quantified on arbitrary scales to maximize humor. The variables are combined into a single formula to calculate the favoritism score \( F \) for the child in question.
