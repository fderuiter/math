The calculated favoritism score provides an amusing quantification of maternal favoritism, highlighting the absurdity of attempting to measure such a subjective phenomenon mathematically. The formula combines a mix of legitimate mathematical operations with whimsical variables, resulting in an exaggerated portrayal of favoritism.

Potential inconsistencies in the formula stem from the arbitrary assignment of values and weights, the subjective nature of certain variables, and the simplifications made in the integrals. Cultural, psychological, and familial factors that influence favoritism are not fully captured, emphasizing the satirical intent of the model.
