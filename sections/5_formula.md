## 5. The Favoritism Formula

The complete satirical favoritism formula is presented as:

\[
F = \frac{\left( \displaystyle \int_0^T \frac{1}{x(t)} \, dt \right) \cdot \left( \displaystyle \iint_S e(x, t) \, dx \, dt \right) \cdot \det(G) \cdot \left( \vec{C} \cdot \vec{w} \right) \cdot \log(1 + f(t)) \cdot P_{\text{total}} \cdot B \cdot M \cdot H \cdot S \cdot D \cdot R}{\displaystyle \int_0^T \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{S_i(t)} \, dt}
\]

**Where:**

- The numerator aggregates positive contributions to favoritism.
- The denominator accounts for the mitigating effect of siblings' proximity to mom.

**Each component is explained as follows:**

1. **Proximity Integral**: Measures the cumulative effect of physical closeness to mom over time.

2. **Emotional Support Integral**: Quantifies the emotional support provided to mom over space and time.

3. **Gift-Giving Matrix Determinant**: Represents the combined impact of emotional and practical gifts.

4. **Compliments Score**: Calculates the weighted sum of compliments based on mom's appreciation.

5. **Frequency of Contact**: Applies a logarithmic function to model diminishing returns of frequent contact.

6. **Personality Score \( P_{\text{total}} \)**: Sums the weighted personality traits valued by mom.

7. **Birth Order \( B \)**: Incorporates the influence of birth order on favoritism.

8. **Major Life Events \( M \)**: Adds points for significant accomplishments or milestones.

9. **Health Crisis Factor \( H \)**: Enhances favoritism if assistance was provided during a crisis.

10. **Social Media Activity \( S \)**: Rewards engagement with mom's social media presence.

11. **Favorability Decay \( D \)**: Models the decrease in favoritism over time since last contact.

12. **Sibling Proximity Sum**: Accounts for siblings' closeness to mom, reducing the favoritism score.

13. **Randomness \( R \)**: Introduces variability to simulate mom's unpredictable mood swings.
