# Math Explorer

This repository is a collection of mathematical concepts explored programmatically in Rust. The goal is to create a library of well-documented, well-tested, and maintainable mathematical algorithms and data structures, implemented from first principles.

## Structure

This project is organized as a single Rust library crate with a modular structure. Different areas of mathematics are separated into their own modules within the `src` directory.

- `src/algebra`: Contains concepts related to algebra.
- `src/number_theory`: Contains concepts related to number theory.

## Usage

This is a library, so it can be included as a dependency in other Rust projects. Each module is self-contained and provides public functions for its respective domain.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, but suggestions and contributions are welcome. Please ensure any new code is well-tested and documented.
