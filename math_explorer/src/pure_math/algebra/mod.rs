//! # Algebra
//!
//! This module is dedicated to concepts from abstract and linear algebra.
//! It will include structures like groups, rings, fields, vector spaces,
//! and algorithms related to them.

/// A placeholder function to demonstrate module structure.
///
/// This function adds two unsigned 64-bit integers. It's a stand-in for
/// more complex algebraic operations that will be implemented in the future.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use math_explorer::pure_math::algebra::placeholder_add;
/// assert_eq!(placeholder_add(2, 2), 4);
/// ```
pub fn placeholder_add(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
    a + b
}
