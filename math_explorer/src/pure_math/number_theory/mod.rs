//! # Number Theory
//!
//! This module focuses on concepts from number theory, the study of integers.
//! It will include algorithms for primality testing, factorization, modular arithmetic,
//! and other number-theoretic functions.

/// A placeholder function to check for primality.
///
/// This function is a stand-in for a more robust primality test.
/// It currently only returns `true` for the number 2.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use math_explorer::pure_math::number_theory::is_prime_placeholder;
/// assert!(is_prime_placeholder(2));
/// assert!(!is_prime_placeholder(4));
/// ```
pub fn is_prime_placeholder(n: u64) -> bool {
    n == 2
}
