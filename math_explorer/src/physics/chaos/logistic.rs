//! Discrete Chaos (The Logistic Map)
//!
//! This module implements the Logistic Map, a classic example of how complex, chaotic behavior
//! can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations.
//!
//! The map is defined by the recurrence relation:
//! $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$

/// Number of iterations to discard as transient before collecting attractor points.
pub const TRANSIENT_STEPS: usize = 100;

/// # Returns
///
/// A vector of tuples `(r, x)`, where `r` is the parameter value and `x` is a visited state
/// on the attractor.
