//! # Angular Momentum Coupling
//!
//! This module provides functions related to the coupling of angular momenta
//! in quantum mechanics.
use wigner_symbols::ClebschGordan;

/// Calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling two angular momenta.
///
/// In quantum mechanics, when combining two angular momenta, j1 and j2, the
/// resulting angular momentum, j, can take on values from |j1 - j2| to j1 + j2.
/// The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted <j1 m1; j2 m2 | j m>, give the
/// probability amplitude for finding the system in the state |j m> when the
/// individual components are in states |j1 m1> and |j2 m2>.
///
/// This function serves as a practical implementation of the coefficients used
/// in the theoretical proof found in `tensors.tex`.
///
/// The inputs are treated as doubles, allowing for half-integer spins (e.g., 1/2 = 0.5).
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `j1` - The total angular momentum quantum number of the first system.
/// * `m1` - The projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis for the first system.
/// * `j2` - The total angular momentum quantum number of the second system.
/// * `m2` - The projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis for the second system.
/// * `j`  - The total angular momentum quantum number of the combined system.
/// * `m`  - The projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis for the combined system.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient as an `f64`. Returns 0.0 if the
/// combination of quantum numbers is not allowed.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// // Example from Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed., Table 4.8
/// // Example from Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed., Table 4.8
/// // Coupling j1=3/2 and j2=1. We expect <3/2 -1/2; 1 1 | 5/2 1/2> = sqrt(3/5).
/// // Note: this library may use a different normalization convention. See tests for details.
