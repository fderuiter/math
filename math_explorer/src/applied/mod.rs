//! # Applied Mathematics
//!
//! This module serves as a collection of mathematical models applied to specific,
//! often niche or complex, domains. It demonstrates how core mathematical concepts
//! (calculus, statistics, game theory) translate into practical solutions.
//!
//! ## Domains
//!
//! - **Biology & Medicine**: `clinical_trials`, `pharmacokinetics`, `freesurfer`, `cannibalism`.
//! - **Physics & Engineering**: `battery_degradation`, `isosurface`.
//! - **Artificial Intelligence**: `lorahub`, `grpo`.
//! - **Social Science (Satire)**: `favoritism`.
//! - **General Algorithms**: `algorithms`, `win_ratio`.
