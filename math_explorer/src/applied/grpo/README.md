# Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen)
![Domain](https://img.shields.io/badge/domain-applied-blue)

A Reinforcement Learning algorithm designed for reasoning tasks, which optimizes a policy
by evaluating a *group* of outputs for a given input, rather than a single output.

GRPO estimates the "advantage" of a response by comparing its reward to the average
reward of other responses in the same group. This reduces gradient variance without
needing a separate Value Network (Critic).
